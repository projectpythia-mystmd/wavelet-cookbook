    "Time-series data refers to data recorded in successive time intervals. For example, imagine a short piece of music. Each note in the piece can be any note from A to G and varies based on frequency to produce different pitches. A higher frequency is associated with a higher pitch, like an A note, while a lower frequency is associated with a lower pitch, like a C note.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourier Transform is a common tool to analyze and pull out which frequencies are present in a signal. With tools like Fourier Transform, we can easily distinguish and determine if a B and a D note appear in the piece of music. However, this does not encapulsate all the information from a signal. \n",

    "**Most importantly, what is the order?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The musical piece \"BDDB\" is very different from \"DDDDBD\" while they both share the same notes B and D. The time and order of data is lost when relying only on signal processing tools like Fourier Transform. Wavelets offer a powerful opportunity for signal analysis to return both information about the frequency and information about the time when the frequency occurred."

    "## Summary\n",
    "Wavelets are a powerful tool for processing time-series data. While Fourier Transforms are a common method of signal analysis, they only return the information about the frequency of the signal and not when the frequencies occur or their duration. Wavelets are an answer to this limitation in Fourier Transform. However, due to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, it is impossible to exactly know both the exact frequency and the exact time that the frequency occurs in a signal. Fourier Transform can return highly precise information about the frequencies in a signal and the wavelet transform can return both the frequency and time, but by reducing the precision of the frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how this precision varies, but as a result it can be useful to not entirely abandon Fourier Transform. Wavelets and Fourier Transform can both be used to analyze data, by utilizing their strengths and offsetting each others weaknesses. \n",
